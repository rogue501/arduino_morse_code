# arduino_morse_code
Morse Code blinker written in Assembly for Arduino boards

I developed this program for a Computer Science course I was taking: Computer Architecture. The assignment was to use a very limited instruction set to develop a program in assembly for an Adruino board that would blink out morse code using the boards LED. I broke the project down into blocks, and first calculated how many commands I'd need for x amount of time -- I built loops that were timed, and then used these like functions to create the numbers I was tasked with. I then had a sort of "main" set up where I'd essentially call the top level functions. I'm sure there are much easier methods of doing all this, but I'm very proud of what I came up with given the limited instruction set allowed. I ended up with an 'A' in the course. 

Feel free to modify and use if it helps you -- but if you have this assignment in class - DO NOT use my code to cheat. It won't help you. Use my code for ideas, and build something better.
